# M6 Generator-Declared Relationships Checklist

**Milestone:** M6 — Generator-Declared Relationships  
**Status:** ✅ **SEALED** (Overhead v1 — 2026-07-05)

---

## Scope (v1)

- Overhead skeleton declares structural joints (BP↔D0, BP↔FP0, D0↔FP0, T1↔T2)
- Declarations emitted in Overhead generator JSON (`relationshipDeclarations`)
- Assembly component stores declarations attribute for reconcile
- Reconcile declarations against design-intent bbox geometry (`bboxSource: design_preferred`)
- `generator_declared` verification when geometry matches
- Preview + cut plan accept declared + geometry-validated relationships

---

## Runners

| Script | Environment |
|--------|-------------|
| `tests/run_connect_pipeline_smoke_offline.py` | Terminal — **M6–M9 unified offline** (includes M6 step) |
| **`connect_pipeline_smoke.py`** (plugin root) | Fusion Scripts & Add-Ins — **M6–M9 unified Fusion** |

**Install into Fusion (removes legacy m6/m7 scripts):**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/install_connect_pipeline_smoke.ps1
```

Then Fusion → Scripts and Add-Ins → Run → **connect_pipeline_smoke**

## Results (2026-07-05)

**Offline:**

```text
M6 offline: PASS
declarations=4 geometryOk=4
BP↔D0: generator_declared + geometryValidation.ok + cut plan OK
```

JSON: `tests/output/connect_pipeline_smoke_offline_results.json` (regenerated; gitignored)

**Fusion:**

```text
M6 Connect smoke: PASS
Declarations: 4 / 4 geometry OK
Fusion 2703.1.20
```

JSON: `tests/output/m6_fusion_smoke_results.json`

---

## Completed for M6 seal

- [x] Fusion smoke: generate Overhead → reconcile → cut on declared BP↔D0
- [x] Emit declarations from Overhead generation JSON (`modules/overheadCabinet/relationshipDeclarations.ts`)
- [x] Write declarations to assembly component attribute on Fusion body create
- [x] Reconcile loads embedded declarations from assembly (fallback: Python catalog)

---

## After M6 (next milestones)

1. **General Tall** — same declaration + reconcile pattern (M6 extension, not blocking M7)
2. **M7 Formal Connect UI** — product-facing relationship/hardware UI
3. **M8 Panel Metadata Writeback** — body-level `features[]` sync after cut
4. **M9 Expand Hardware Types** — tongue/groove, hinge, lock, runner
