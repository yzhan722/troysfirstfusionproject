# M5 Face Verification Checklist

**Milestone:** M5 — Face-Level Relationship Verification  
**Status:** ✅ **SEALED** (2026-07-05, Fusion 2703.1.20, fixture smoke PASS)

---

## Prerequisites

- [x] M4.6A sealed
- [x] Offline face verification tests PASS
- [x] Fusion smoke on fixture pair (`m5_connect_smoke.py`)
- [ ] Fusion smoke on real Overhead pair (optional v1 follow-up)

---

## Offline runners

| Script | Environment |
|--------|-------------|
| `python -m unittest tests.test_face_verification` | Terminal |
| `tests/run_relationship_regression.py` | Terminal (includes face + declared tests) |

M5 one-click smoke scripts (`m5_connect_smoke.py`, `run_m5_smoke_offline.py`) were removed after seal.

## Fusion workflow (Debug UI)

```text
1. Create Relationship Fixture
2. Select REL_EDGE_A + REL_SURFACE_B (or any 2 panel bodies)
3. Verify Face Contact For Selected Pair
4. Preview Screw Holes (optional)
5. Create Screw Holes — face_verified skips manual confirm
```

Route: `relationships.verifySelectedPairFaces`

---

## Acceptance (v1)

```text
- edge_to_surface fixture pair → face_verified, matchedFaceAId/BId reported
- surface_to_surface fixture pair → face_verified
- gap_parallel / intersection → rejected
- cut gate accepts face_verified
- bbox_candidate still blocked without verify/confirm
```
